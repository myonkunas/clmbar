Adaptation of dvdl.py from http://ambermd.org/tutorials/advanced/tutorial9/#analysis
compute the free energy difference between states using equilibrium MD trajectories
from multiple probability densities as in the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio
MBAR

Usage
-----
This is a common lisp implementation used within the CANDO software platform available via Docker:
```bash
docker pull thirdlaw/cando
```

See the README for running CANDO in Docker: https://github.com/cando-developers/cando/blob/master/README.md
